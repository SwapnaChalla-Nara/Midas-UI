# Deployment Specification for MiDAS Front-End

## Branching Strategy

### GitFlow Workflow

The project follows a GitFlow branching strategy:

- **main**: Production-ready code. Deployments to production are triggered by merges to this branch.
- **develop**: Integration branch for features. Deployments to staging are triggered by merges to this branch.
- **feature/**: Feature branches created from develop
- **hotfix/**: Emergency fixes created from main
- **release/**: Release preparation branches

### Branch Protection Rules

- **main branch**:
  - Require pull request reviews
  - Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Include administrators in restrictions

- **develop branch**:
  - Require pull request reviews
  - Require status checks to pass before merging

## Build Process

### CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The deployment process uses GitHub Actions and consists of three main jobs:

1. **Test Job**: Runs on all pushes and pull requests
2. **Deploy Staging**: Runs on pushes to develop branch
3. **Deploy Production**: Runs on pushes to main branch

### Build Steps

#### 1. Environment Setup
- Checkout source code
- Setup Node.js 18.x
- Install dependencies using `npm ci`

#### 2. Quality Assurance
- Run ESLint for code quality checks
- Execute unit tests using Vitest
- Halt pipeline on any failures

#### 3. Build Generation
- Execute `npm run build` to create optimized static files
- Generate source maps for debugging
- Create vendor chunk splitting for better caching

#### 4. Artifact Management
- Upload build artifacts for deployment jobs
- Retain artifacts for potential rollbacks

## Deployment Pipeline Steps

### Staging Deployment (develop branch)

**Trigger**: Automatic on push to develop branch

1. **Download Artifacts**: Retrieve build files from test job
2. **AWS Configuration**: Setup credentials using GitHub secrets
3. **S3 Sync**: Upload files to staging S3 bucket
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync dist/ s3://midas-ui-staging --delete
   ```
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Clear CloudFront cache
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id STAGING_ID --paths "/*"
   ```

### Production Deployment (main branch)

**Trigger**: Automatic on push to main branch

1. **Download Artifacts**: Retrieve build files from test job
2. **AWS Configuration**: Setup credentials using GitHub secrets
3. **S3 Sync**: Upload files to production S3 bucket
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync dist/ s3://midas-ui-production --delete
   ```
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Clear CloudFront cache
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id PRODUCTION_ID --paths "/*"
   ```

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-deployment Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function tests
- **Linting**: Code style and quality validation
- **Build Verification**: Ensure application builds successfully

### Post-deployment Testing
- **Smoke Tests**: Verify basic application functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor loading times and metrics
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Critical errors detected in production
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

### Rollback Process

#### Method 1: Re-deploy Previous Build
1. Navigate to GitHub Actions workflow history
2. Identify the last successful deployment
3. Re-run the deployment job for that commit
4. Monitor deployment completion and application status

#### Method 2: Git Revert (for urgent fixes)
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Revert problematic commits
3. Create pull request and merge after review
4. Automatic deployment triggers new build

#### Method 3: Manual S3 Rollback
```bash
# List previous versions
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket midas-ui-production

# Restore specific version
aws s3api restore-object --bucket midas-ui-production --key index.html --version-id VERSION_ID

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id PRODUCTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

### Rollback Verification
1. Verify application loads correctly
2. Check critical functionality
3. Monitor error rates and performance metrics
4. Communicate status to stakeholders

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Deployment success/failure rates
- Application load times
- Error rates and types
- CloudFront cache hit ratios
- S3 request metrics

### Alert Conditions
- Deployment failures
- Application downtime
- High error rates (>5% for 5 minutes)
- Performance degradation (>50% increase in load time)

## Security Considerations

### Deployment Security
- Use least-privilege IAM roles
- Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets
- Enable audit logging for all AWS resources
- Regular security updates for dependencies

### Runtime Security
- HTTPS-only access via CloudFront
- Security headers configuration
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimizations
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Asset compression and minification
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Vendor chunk separation for better caching

### CDN Optimizations
- Appropriate cache headers for different asset types
- Gzip compression enabled
- HTTP/2 support
- Edge caching configuration
